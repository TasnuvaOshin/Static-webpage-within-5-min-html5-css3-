player who has set records while playing for
 both Manchester United and Real Madrid.
Who Is Cristiano Ronaldo?
Born on February 5, 1985, 
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro is a
 Portuguese soccer superstar. By 2003 — 
 when he was just 16 years old — 
 Manchester paid £12 million 
 (over $14 million U.S. dollars) 
 to sign him, a record fee for a player 
 of his age. In the 2004 FA Cup final,
 Ronaldo scored Manchester's first three 
 goals and helped them capture the championship.
 In 2008, he set a franchise record for goals
 scored. In 2009, Real Madrid paid a record 
 $131 million for his services.</p>
